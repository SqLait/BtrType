#+TITLE: BtrTypes

A collection of header files to improve C types. 
It implements some better naming and abstraction for types.

* Code sample:

  Writing C or C++ you will use these types most of the time:

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
  
  float x = 32f;
  int y = 32;
  char m = 'm';
  char* mm = "mm\0";
  double xx = 64f;

  #+END_SRC

  This lib gives you more consice types like those of rust. Plus some basic abstraction like vectors, color and more.

* IMPORTANT:

  This is not going to be a very large project. Rather it is ment more for me while creating C programs
